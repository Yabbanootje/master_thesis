# Master Thesis: Safe Step by Safe Step: Curriculum Learning in Constrained Reinforcement Learning

This is the code repository for my master thesis, which can be found here: TODO.

## Figures

All figures used in the thesis and more can be found in the `figures` folder.

## Running experiments

All of the experiments used in the thesis can be found in the `experiments` folder.

First install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

To run a specific experiment, just run the corresponding file in a code editor or run
`python experiments/<experiment>.py`, where `<experiment>` is the respective experiment.
